## Features

The wine dataset includes several features that describe various characteristics of different wines. Each sample in the dataset is labeled with a wine category, which can take one of the three values: 0, 1, or 2 standing for: 

- **0** (*Variety A*): Description of Variety A wines.

- **1** (*Variety B*): Description of Variety B wines.

- **2** (*Variety C*): Description of Variety C wines.

Also a brief explanation of some of the key features:

1. **Alcohol**: The alcohol content of the wine, measured in percentage.

2. **Malic_acid**: The amount of malic acid in the wine, which can influence its taste.

3. **Ash**: The amount of ash present in the wine, a measure of mineral content.

4. **Alcalinity**: The alkalinity of the ash in the wine, which can affect its acidity.

5. **Magnesium**: The concentration of magnesium in the wine.

6. **Phenols**: The total amount of phenolic compounds in the wine, contributing to its flavor.

7. **Flavanoids**: The amount of flavonoids in the wine, responsible for its color and taste.

8. **Nonflavanoid Phenols**: The amount of non-flavonoid phenolic compounds in the wine.

9. **Proanthocyanins**: The concentration of proanthocyanins, which are antioxidants.

10. **Color_intensity**: The intensity of the color of the wine.

11. **Hue**: The hue or color shade of the wine.

12. **OD280_315_of_diluted_wines**: The ratio of optical density at 280nm and 315nm, providing information about the color.

13. **Proline**: The amount of proline, an amino acid, in the wine.

These features collectively contribute to the classification of wines into one of the three categories: Variety A, Variety B, or Variety C.
